Simple homedir creation script written in Python.

This script assumes that you have sufficient privs to sudo on the box you use to create the directories. 

Usage: chmod +x a.py then execute with one argument:
sudo ./a.py username

You can easily disable the root user check if you so wish. 

I'll be looking at creating an interactive version of this script so you can run it and keep inputting usernames without having to rerun the process constantly.
